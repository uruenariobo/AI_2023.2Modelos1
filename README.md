# NYC Taxi Fare Prediction Challenge

Welcome to the NYC Taxi Fare Prediction Challenge repository! This project is part of the competition hosted on Kaggle, where the goal is to predict taxi fare amounts in New York City based on various features.

## Competition Overview

The [New York City Taxi Fare Prediction Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/new-york-city-taxi-fare-prediction/overview) aims to improve the accuracy of fare amount predictions for taxi rides in NYC using machine learning techniques. The primary evaluation metric is the Root Mean-Squared Error (RMSE), where smaller values indicate better predictive performance.

The challenge is to develop predictive models that can estimate taxi fare amounts more accurately than basic distance-based estimates.

## Project Objectives

In this project, we will develop and deploy a predictive model to estimate taxi fare amounts. The first phase focuses on building the prediction model, and the Jupyter Notebook file for this phase is located in the `fase-1` directory. Below are the steps to execute Phase 1 successfully:

## Phase 1: Prediction Model

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   - Start by cloning this repository to your local environment using Git. Open your terminal and run the following command:

     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/uruenariobo/AI_2023.2Modelos1.git
     ```

2. **Download Python 3.11:**
   - Make sure you have Python 3.11 installed on your system. You can download it from the official Python website [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3110/).

3. **Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional):**
   - To manage Python dependencies, consider creating a virtual environment. You can create one using the following commands:

     ```bash
     python3 -m venv venv
     source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use "venv\Scripts\activate"
     ```

4. **Open the Project in Visual Studio Code:**
   - If you haven't already, download and install Visual Studio Code (VS Code) from the official website: [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

   - Launch VS Code and open the project folder. You can do this by selecting "File" > "Open Folder" and selecting the folder where you cloned the repository.

5. **Execute Python Code:**
   - To run Python scripts in VS Code, open the Jupyter Notebook file `fase-1/nyc-taxi-fares-eda-modelling-2-93.ipynb`. You can execute code cells in the notebook individually by selecting the cell and clicking the "Run Cell" button (▶️) or using the keyboard shortcut (Shift+Enter).

   - Ensure that your Python environment is correctly configured, and the required packages are installed.

## Next Phases

Stay tuned for subsequent phases of this project, where we will deploy the model in a container and create a RESTful API for predictions.

We hope you enjoy participating in this project and challenge. Happy modeling!
